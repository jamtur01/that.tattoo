Sometime in the 1950s, my grandfather visited the black forest region of Germany, to a small town named Calw, and (presumably after some research) found a church that had some stained glass with our family's shield. He sat in the church and made a drawing of the shield. When he got home, he made [a carving of the shield](/img/portfolio/paul-sanwald-2.jpg), and gave it to my dad, who gave it to me.

 I've had the carving hung up on the wall for forever, but until recently, it didn't occur to me what an awesome tattoo this could be. As I was deciding to get this tattooed on my forearm, we did a little research, and my wife used a combination of google earth and image search to find a picture of [the stained glass window(!)](/img/portfolio/Calw-Sanwald-Church.jpg), using only the description my grandfather gave on the back of the carving. It's a pretty cool visual image, and it also reminds me of my grandfather, who was a great guy.
