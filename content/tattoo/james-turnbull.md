I've always been a huge sci-fi fan. As a teenager I read a lot vintage 1940s and 50s science fiction. One of the first books from the era I read was Robert Heinlein's Orphans of the Sky: the one of the earliest "generation ship" novels.

Reading that book, and other genre fiction, basically shaped my personal and professional interests in genre and technology. I wanted to mark that memory using the art from the cover of my favorite edition: the 1977 release Panther Science Fiction. The cover art was drawn by the prolific and talented [Peter Andrew Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Andrew_Jones) and the tattoo was done by the amazing [Annie Lloyd](https://getfatbk.com/) at Get Fat Brooklyn.

The original cover:
