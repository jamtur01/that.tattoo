This piece is a memorial tattoo for my stepfather. The morning after he passed, the family saw a pair of swallowtail butterflies - his and my mom's favorite to watch - flying around the hydrangeas in the yard - their favorite flowers. The knotted climbing ropes are a reminder of the times we would go rock climbing together. I really appreciate being able to carry these family memories around with me.
