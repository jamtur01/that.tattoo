Hi all

I just built a thing, https://that.tattoo, based on Daniel Bogan's https://usesthis.com/. I was inspired by someone asking me, for the millionth time, about one of my tattoos and its backstory. I always see tattoos and wonder: "What does it mean? What inspired it? What's the backstory?" In a lot of cases, there is a meaning, in other cases sometimes it is just: "this is a cool thing I love having on my skin". 

I am collecting those tattoos and their stories (or not stories) and was hoping you all would be among the initial group of contributors. Some of you I know in person and others online where we've chatted tattoos. I'd be thrilled if you were interested in being part of it. 

If you are interested, I need:

1. A high quality image of the tattoo.
2. Some words on its meaning or why you like it or...
3. A one sentence bio with any links you like to your personal stuff - Twitter, etc.

Thanks for your time!

Cheers

James
